Kirocc: he did not spam the storms

Kirocc: he shouldnt focused the interceptors

aerialace94: This was like 1am I believe brain not functioning

aerialace94: Recall

lastadolkg: aerialace94 I had a bad preconcieved opinion toward your person due to F2 use.. but storming interceptors to death, consider that bad preconcieved opinion retracted

Nautilatorr: welp

Kirocc: no more void rays either bc the stargate got unpowered

ArmchairGeneral: It might be because of the cost of reacting to it all? I mean, it keeps buying him time to murder the forward and deals 'some' economy damage while building up.

crassculture: Cheesus crust.

Nautilatorr: did somebody soundbite that?

Draknas_sc: something I'd do

christoffelcymbal: is a fucking ultralisk the same thing as a normal ultralisk? @Maynarde

KityLinn: tippyS

retentionsamurai: lol

Fridge_SA: this is many ultralisks

retentionsamurai: hope he splits them up

nikos13ole: this is a meatgrinder

KityLinn: oof

crassculture: Aaaand 4 lonely roaches walking in

5m4llP0X: rofl

CityWanderer: that tank must have a good kill count

Fridge_SA: imagine if the ultras had been attacking the whole time

crassculture: those 4 should've been ravagers

Nautilatorr: "what in god's name fuck am i looking at here" - maynarde, 2021

ArmchairGeneral: I think I just had an anuerism

viriato109: is this a godzilla movie

HellCOWz_Gaming: no zerg escapes alive

HellCOWz_Gaming: LUL

Hallafax: how many kills do those widow memes have

retentionsamurai: COME ON TERRAN YOU CAN DO IT

Astronest: how many kills do those widow mines have?

nox7bitfaster: killcount of tank?

ArmchairGeneral: I want 6 more Factories built right now.

Draknas_sc: the zergs spirit is broken at this point

KityLinn: nardeWee

retentionsamurai: yeah that tank has a lot of kills

toyness: LUL

HellCOWz_Gaming: i bet the zerg says terran op or something LUL

christoffelcymbal: terran is just OP Kappa

Nautilatorr: box art push coming?

hurt0ne: A 30 kill tank should called Fury

Draknas_sc: I like the zerglings. nothing else but I like the lings

Chrishansen15: @HellCOWz_Gaming They're just a micro intensive race. Tank 0 micro, lib 0 micro, widow, 0 micro Kappa

crassculture: Goooooood job.

HellCOWz_Gaming: LUL LUL

TSBspartacus: LUL

KityLinn: pro caster

MrAndersenTV: yo this looks like how I play LUL

KityLinn: PridePog

crassculture: Fingers.

crassculture: How do they work?

Kirocc: mroe brain cells will be lost now

CityWanderer: oh good we get to see the fight again

MaruAmoriani: I am hype as fuck!

crassculture: Fingers gonna fing.

Kirocc: we have to see the ultras move cmd again

Nautilatorr: that really was THE fight

retentionsamurai: Sometimes it seems like people can move thorugh replays real easy, but I never can.... not sure if it's my computer?

ArmchairGeneral: And wings!

crassculture: Yaaaaaaawwn. Long game.

MaruAmoriani: Started back working out and I can actually run most of a mile, about 1.2 KM, again!

Kirocc: do slow mode when at ultra fight

crassculture: plz no haha

keenster88: That's wierd, watching zerg creep move when you're fast-forwarding

tatert00ter: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Kirocc: haha xD

hurt0ne: Pigs feet are great though

MaruAmoriani: My goal of hitting a 10KM run is within my grasp!

Cartogan: didnt know thor had this air range

Pandolfo_Malatesta: Yes, but ribs, at least when prepared correctly, slide right off the bone, so far less effort is required in eating them.

Nautilatorr: this is it

Hallafax: how many kills doe the widow mines at the door have

5m4llP0X: Now time for another Ctrl+E

KityLinn: 12K more resources lost

hurt0ne: @maruamoriani that is great!

tatert00ter: Bah and 2 hours till dinner.

CityWanderer: why are the overlords poopinn

MaruAmoriani: @hurt0ne Thanks man

Fridge_SA: could the zerg win with only zerglings? I think he could

Philosapharaptor: im working up to a 10k on weekends

puppyman42: it would be cool if mine showed how many times it fired

Philosapharaptor: currently do 5k's all week :D

christoffelcymbal: 10k ribs? @Maynarde

Pandolfo_Malatesta: My goal of being a fat fuck is well established.

crassculture: neuroYikes

jdubya181: thor stonk stronk invest now

crassculture: I just spent last night drilling macro. For hhooouuurrrss.

hurt0ne: What is “macro”

Hallafax: money is worthless if you don't spend it

5m4llP0X: Zerg's favorite pro is Bly.

Nautilatorr: i like bly.

5m4llP0X: Bly is great, but his go-to units are Broodlords and Ultras.

hurt0ne: Me me me

Pandolfo_Malatesta: Bly and those corrosive blyles...

crassculture: Good tank surround

Lynx__oce: I believe bunny has the best TvP right now ?

Pandolfo_Malatesta: Gabe looked on point in last week's tourney. I don't know if he'll take IEM, but he'll definitely stand high in it.

nox7bitfaster: well god sentenced the fallen angles to never set food to heaven again and the church gave absolute absolution if one passes a specific gate

Lynx__oce: He seems to know how to just out maneuver them

Nautilatorr: might be time for ZEST to be the BEST

CommodoreRuru: Queen union decided it was Smoko

Doom_of_Malantai\s: he's up there with serral and raynor

crassculture: I feel like Showtime is good at LADDERING, but kinda fifty-fifty in tourneys

crassculture: And I'm a big Showtime fan.

5m4llP0X: Showtime is great and I always hope he wins.

Lynx__oce: I do really want innovation to win something before he goes to military service this year :(

zapman17: At that point you don't even gain any MMR from people below 60k

5m4llP0X: I think he wants cigarettes.

5m4llP0X: Yeah, we bought a 10lb tube of ground beef, some steaks, pork, veggies, fruit, and other things to hold ourselves over.

5m4llP0X: @Maynarde We had roads and highways where the police set up checkpoints and required people to have chains to pass.

Nautilatorr: these banes look like ground pufferfish

u1849ka: I had a pass in my glove box explaining that I was an essential worker, etc., but never had to use it.

Agamemnon_J: pog doom

5m4llP0X: Ah, grandfathered in. Awesome.

Agamemnon_J: 0% is leaving all the progression items i think... so no sentinel crystals for instance, but you can skip too

minddistorter: isn't 0% beating the game with as few as pickups as possible?

ByteMe: It's a challenge run: Full combat rating (per level that tracks it), no secrets, no mission challenge progress, no weapon mods, no runes, no upgrades (argent, praetor, or weapon)

Dubstepp503: 0% is also what i call my life FeelsBadMan

ByteMe: You would love 0%

5m4llP0X: He does like being brutalized.

crassculture: Kappa

crassculture: Duly noted.

Zepph: doom vlogs when

il_messia_blasfemo: "pew pew"

5m4llP0X: There is a limit to your suffering.

Zepph: soon (TM)

Zaelsus: Pistol only UN run, true masochism

Agamemnon_J: if you start charging the pistol (dont wait) (think PB in eternal) it hits the centre accurately

Agamemnon_J: if you fire normally its so RNG
